# DarcleITS
[![Project Status: Concept - Minimal or no implementation has been done yet.](http://www.repostatus.org/badges/0.1.0/concept.svg)](http://www.repostatus.org/#concept)

An R package for parsing LENA's .ITS files.

## Proof of Concept

There are just two functions at the moment: `load_its_file` which loads the ITS file
in R as an XML document and `make_conversation_df` which collects the attributes
of every `<Conversation>` node.

```{r}
library("DarcleITS")
library("dplyr")
conversations <- "tests/testthat/data/file-for-testing.its" %>% 
  load_its_file %>% 
  make_conversation_df
conversations
```

Now, we can start mining this data-frame of conversations.

```{r}
# Create long data-frame of word counts
library("tidyr")
word_counts <- conversations %>% 
  select(num, Time = startTime, 
         Female = femaleAdultWordCnt, Male = maleAdultWordCnt) %>% 
  gather(Speaker, Count, -num, -Time) %>% 
  filter(Count != 0)

library("ggplot2")
ggplot(word_counts) + 
  aes(x = Time, y = Count, color = Speaker) + 
  geom_point() + 
  ylab("Adult Word Count Per Conversation")
```
